# Module Plans

## General Notes
    Some tasks/methods/utilites are common between the tasks so they could extract into a general utility file.
### Error handling utility file
- There are a variety of errors to be checked for, however they can be slotted into different categories
- A method for handling each type of error as provided by the specs

### PGM utility file
- Each task requires the opening and closing of .pgm files
- Method for handling the inputing of .pgm files into data structures
- Data structures for storing .pgm image data intermnally
- contains the pgm2a and pgm2b utilities 
- Method for handling the outputing .pgm files using data structures

## Task 1 - echo
- Method for input error handling
- Method for output error handling

## Task 2 - compare
- Have a method for reading in a pgm file
    - Method should store the file data in a temporary data structure
- Method to validate if an input file is a valid pgm file
- Method for comparing 2 files which are stored in data structures in the script
    - subroutine for handingling comparison and errors

## Task 3 - ASCII/binary
- Method to validate input file as valid pgm file
- Method that decides if input is in binary or ASCII
- pgma2b method --> converts ASCII, TO binary
- pgmb2a method --> converts binary, TO ASCII
- Method for outputting data structure into a file

## Task 4 - reduce
- Method for validatating commandline inputs
- Method for reading in the file and storing it in a temporary data structure
- Method for calculating and downsizing img
- Method for output data structure into a file

## Task 5 - tile
- Method for validating commandline inputs
- Method for inputting file data into script data structure
- Method for creating a array of tiles which the img is broken down into
    - subroutine for cropping/adding onto image so that it fits the tile sizes
- Method for outputting the tiles into separate .pgm files

## Task 6 - assemble
- Method for validating commandline inputs
    - subroutine check if all expected .pgm files are present
- Method for validating if collection of .pgm files are valid
- Method for taking in a collection of .pgm image files and storing it in an internal data structure
- Method putting together tiles in correct manner
- Method for taking the finaly assembled tiles and outputting a img  file
